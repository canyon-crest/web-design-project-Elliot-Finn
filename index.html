    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

<br>
<p>My name is Elliot and I am sixteen years old. I have lived in San 
Diego for most of my life, from kindergarten to fourth grade and 
from sixth grade to now. However, I lived in Boston, Massachusetts
 for two years when I was eleven and twelve where my mom did her 
 fellowship to become a child psychiatrist. I went to three different
  elementary schools and have moved 5 times in my life. I have a 
  fraternal twin brother named Asher as well as a younger sister 
  named Anya. Recently, I got my drivers license, and have gotten 
  to drive around a new and beautiful <a href=

<H3>Hobbies</H3>

<br>
<p id="p2">I play the flute as well as the piano as hobbies. I take flute 
lessons and have been for five years, which I really enjoy. I also 
am on a robotics team outside of school and enjoy 3d modeling and 
design in my spare time, which I mainly use <a href=

Fusion 360 with a student license</a> for. I also know basic 
Python programming from when I took lessons in sixth 
grade. I enjoy being on a robotics team because it allows me to make 
interesting things by being creative while under constraints.

<h3>School</h3>

<br>
<p>I am a decent student and I enjoy school because of its routine. My 
favorite academic subject is probably English, because I am an okay 
writer and I love to read and analyze good books. I also was in the 
school’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/sduhsd.net/avillanova/ensembles">
  Wind Ensemble</a> class, which I really enjoyed and look forward
 to being part of again next semester. My least favorite class I have
  taken so far was Biology because it doesn’t really seem to operate 
  under real rules and involves a lot of memorization. Next year, I 
  am excited to take Calculus and physics because I am interested in 
  how I can connect them to the real world.
