          My name is Elliot and I am sixteen years old. I have lived in San 
          Diego for most of my life, from kindergarten to fourth grade and 
          from sixth grade to now. However, I lived in Boston, Massachusetts
          for two years when I was eleven and twelve where my mom did her 
          fellowship to become a child psychiatrist. <span class="highlight">I went to three different
          elementary schools and have moved 5 times in my life.</span> I have a 
          fraternal twin brother named Asher as well as a younger sister 
          named Anya. Recently, I got my drivers license, and have gotten 
          to drive around a new and beautiful <a href=

      <h3 class="tag tag-right">Hobbies</h3>
      <p id="p2"><img src="images/fusion360.png" id="pic2" alt="Fusion 360 logo">I play the flute 
        as well as the piano as hobbies. I take flute 
        lessons and have been for five years, which I really enjoy. I also 
        am on a robotics team outside of school and <span class="highlight">I enjoy 3d modeling and 
        design in my spare time</span>, which I mainly use <a href=
        "https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/fusion">
        Fusion 360 with a student license</a> for. I also know basic 
        Python programming from when I took lessons in sixth 
        grade. I enjoy being on a robotics team because it allows me to make 
        interesting things by being creative while under constraints.

      <h3 class="tag tag-left">School</h3>
      <p><img src="images/book.png" id="pic3" alt="stack of books">I am a decent 
        student and I enjoy school because of its routine. My 
        favorite academic subject is probably English, because I am an okay 
        writer and I love to read and analyze good books. I also was in the 
        school’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/sduhsd.net/avillanova/ensembles">
          Wind Ensemble</a> class, which I really enjoyed and look forward
        to being part of again next semester. My least favorite class I have
        taken so far was Biology because it doesn’t really seem to operate 
        under real rules and involves a lot of memorization. Next year, <span class="highlight">I 
        am excited to take Calculus and physics</span> because I am interested in 
        how I can connect them to the real world.
